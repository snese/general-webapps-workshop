This workshop is a hands-on tutorial of building a website on AWS. You will learn how to build a high-availability application on AWS using the [**AWS Management Console**](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). In Lab 1, we will build a single-instance WordPress website using [**Amazon EC2**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2) and [**Amazon RDS**](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/). In Lab 2, we will then further improve the architecture by adding an [**Auto Scaling Group**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html), an Application Load Balancer ([**Elastic Load Balancing**](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/?nc=sn&loc=0)) and a Content Distribution Network ([**AWS CloudFront**](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront)), making the website more scalable, secure and reliable.
